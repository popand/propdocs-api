## Notes for Coding Agent

### Task Management Guidelines
1. **Mark tasks complete only when fully implemented and tested**
2. **Update progress in real-time as work progresses**
3. **Create subtasks if main tasks are too complex**
4. **Document any blockers or dependencies**
5. **Include evidence of completion (test results, screenshots, etc.)**

### Development Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Document all API endpoints
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use structured logging throughout

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before marking complete
- Code must be linted and formatted
- API documentation must be updated
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Security requirements must be satisfied

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the PropDocs API with clear, actionable tasks that can be tracked and completed systematically.
